## Scoring Rubric

### Context
- RHAIRFE (PM-authored): describes WHAT is needed and WHY — the business need
- RHAISTRAT (engineering-authored): describes HOW — a feature that implements one or more RFEs
- RHOAIENG: epics and stories that deliver the feature
RFEs ideally map to ~1 RHAISTRAT feature.

### Criteria (0-2 each, /10 total)

1. WHAT — Clear customer need?
   Technical terms OK for precision. (0=vague/unclear, 1=ambiguous, 2=clear and specific)

2. WHY — Named customers, revenue, market data?
   - 0 = No justification, or circular reasoning, or hype-chasing with no business case
   - 1 = Generic segments, market positioning, analyst references, competitive gaps — plausible but no customer-level evidence
   - 2 = Named customer accounts, specific revenue/deal impact, analyst ratings with demonstrated customer consequences, OR strategic investment with a clear causal chain showing why this specific capability is required to deliver it
   Score based on the strongest evidence present. Take stated evidence at face value. Search the entire description for evidence, not just a dedicated WHY section.

3. Open to HOW — Leaves architecture to engineering?
   Customer-facing surfaces (API endpoints, CLI flags, CRD fields, UI elements) are WHAT. Internal architecture (pipeline design, database choices, repos, language choices) is HOW.

   The following are established RHOAI platform technologies (as of 3.4). Referencing them is platform vocabulary, not architecture prescription:
   - Platform: RHOAI Operator, ODH Dashboard, OpenShift, OLM
   - Serving: KServe, vLLM, llm-d, ModelMesh, OpenVINO, MLServer, inference runtimes
   - Training: Kubeflow Training Operator/Trainer, KubeRay, Ray, CodeFlare, Spark Operator
   - Pipelines: Data Science Pipelines, Argo Workflows, KFP components
   - Registry & tracking: Model Registry, MLflow, ML Metadata, Model Catalog
   - Safety & eval: TrustyAI, EvalHub, LM Eval Harness, Guardrails Orchestrator, NeMo Guardrails, Garak
   - AI frameworks: Llama Stack (operator + distribution), Feast (feature store)
   - Inference optimization: llm-d scheduler, KV-cache, Batch Gateway, Workload-Variant Autoscaler
   - Workloads: Kueue, distributed workloads
   - Workbenches: Jupyter, VS Code/Code-Server, RStudio, notebook controller
   - Networking: Istio/Service Mesh, Gateway API, OpenShift Routes
   - Monitoring: Prometheus, ServiceMonitors, PodMonitors, Alertmanager
   - Auth: Authorino, OAuth Proxy, kube-auth-proxy, RBAC
   - Storage: S3, PVCs, ModelCar/OCI artifacts, container registries
   - Infrastructure: MaaS, Konflux builds

   Describing what a product does (e.g., "disaggregated prefill/decode" for llm-d) is WHAT.

   Describing UI behavior using common vocabulary (dropdown, toggle, checkbox, input field, wizard, modal, sidebar) is WHAT — it's how people communicate about user-facing surfaces, not architecture.

   Business capabilities (telemetry, usage analytics, observability, audit trails) are WHAT — they describe what the business needs to know, even if they imply infrastructure to collect the data.

   Referencing these technologies is not *automatically* prescriptive, but mandating which platform component should solve a given problem (when alternatives exist) is still an architecture decision.

   Exception: when the customer need is specifically tied to a named technology (e.g., "customers need MLflow Evaluation API support"), naming it is WHAT — the customer need IS that technology.

   Technologies not on the platform vocabulary list:
   - Naming as "the solution" is prescriptive (H=0-1): "Build this using KALE"
   - Naming as a candidate to evaluate is acceptable (H=2): "Engineering should evaluate KALE, Elyra, and other approaches"
   - Naming as the customer need itself is WHAT (H=2): "Customers need Katib-based hyperparameter tuning" — but only when customers specifically require that technology, not when the PM chose it
   The test: if you removed the technology name and described the capability generically, would the RFE still make sense? If yes, the name is a solution choice. If no, it's the need itself.

   Functional requirements phrased as "[verb] [object]" are WHAT when they describe observable outcomes ("identify paraphrased content," "detect drift between versions") and HOW when they prescribe algorithmic approaches ("parse traces using span labeling," "cluster errors by similarity metrics," "calculate distribution divergence using KL divergence"). The test: could engineering achieve the same outcome using a completely different technique? If yes, describe the outcome, not the technique.

   Implementation details presented as non-prescriptive context are acceptable. When an RFE provides implementation details explicitly framed as reference or prior art ("engineering should determine the approach; the following is provided as context"), score based on whether engineering retains genuine freedom to choose a different approach. Context that informs without constraining is not prescriptive. The test: does the RFE still make sense if you ignore the context section entirely? If the business need stands on its own and the implementation details are supplementary, the framing is successful.

   Prescribing HOW means mandating internals *beyond* established platform patterns (e.g., specific DB table schemas, migration tools, plugin architectures, code namespaces).

   - 0 = Mandates internal architecture or links design docs as "the solution"
   - 1 = Leans into implementation but doesn't fully mandate
   - 2 = Describes the need without prescribing architecture; examples OK

4. Not a task — Business need, not activity?
   (0=task/chore/tech debt, 1=borderline, 2=clear business need)

5. Right-sized — Maps to ~1 strategy feature?
   When multiple deliverables are present, test independence: could each
   deliverable ship on its own and provide value? Does each require the
   others to function at all? Deliverables that cannot function without
   each other are one feature regardless of how many acceptance criteria
   they span. Sharing a category or theme does NOT make independently
   shippable items one feature — score based on the independence test,
   not on whether a unifying label exists.
   When the same capability is needed across multiple products or
   deployment targets (e.g., GPU enablement across RHAII, RHEL AI,
   RHOAI), the products are delivery targets, not separate features.
   Score based on whether the capabilities within each target are
   independent, not whether the targets themselves are separate.
   When scoring, first list the independent deliverables you identify.
   Then apply the independence test to each pair. Consolidate any that
   cannot function without each other into a single group. Score based
   on the final count of independent groups.
   - 0 = Needs 3+ independent features (each could ship alone to
     different personas or for different purposes)
   - 1 = Bundles 1-2 separable features — deliverables that could ship
     independently and provide standalone value
   - 2 = Focused single need — deliverables require each other to
     function at all, even if the RFE has many acceptance criteria

### Smell Tests
- "Can engineering propose a different architecture?" (HOW)
- "Can you write one strategy-feature summary for this?" (Right-sized)
- "Could any deliverable ship independently and provide value on its own?" (Right-sized — separable)
- "Does this require another capability to function at all?" (Right-sized — inseparable)
- "Is there a customer or strategic investment driving this?" (WHY)
- "Would this make sense filed as an engineering task?" (Not a task)

### Calibration Examples

#### WHY
- Y=0: "Model Deployment should allow to configure the Route" with body listing only "timeout" and no justification. → No business case at all.
- Y=0: "Users need the ability to reset the vector database state" with detailed problem description but no reference to actual customers, segments, or market data. → Problem statement ≠ business justification.
- Y=1: "Customers requiring air-gapped environments need a supported way to install dependencies without internet access." → Generic customer segment with clear need. No named accounts.
- Y=1: "Request from watsonx customers" with use cases described. → Named customer segment, not named accounts.
- Y=1: "Agents could execute destructive actions due to hallucination, causing data loss and security vulnerabilities." → Security/safety gap in a core capability. Risk mitigation is business justification, but without named customers stays at 1.
- Y=2: "Acme Corp blocked on data residency, €2M deal at risk." → Named customer with revenue impact.
- Y=2: "Sovereign AI is a 2026 strategic investment; sovereign platforms require disconnected operation to comply with data residency." → Strategic investment with causal chain to this specific capability.

#### HOW
- H=0: "Create a plugin architecture with DB migration scripts and a new microservice in the foo-service repo." → Mandates internal architecture.
- H=1: "Propose a shorter-term solution: package a second image with models baked in. Longer term: enable external provider configuration." → Suggests specific approaches but doesn't fully mandate.
- H=2: "Deploy models using llm-d with external route exposure, matching existing KServe serving runtime behavior." → Platform vocabulary, not architecture prescription.
- H=2: "Users can explicitly clear their vector database state and start fresh." → Describes the need without prescribing implementation.
- H=2: "Expose REST API endpoints for programmatic model creation." → API surface is WHAT, not architecture.
- H=2: "Detect when model behavior has changed from its baseline." → Observable outcome. Engineering chooses the detection method.
- H=1: "Parse MLflow traces for tool-call spans and cluster common errors by similarity." → Prescribes the technique (span parsing, similarity clustering) rather than the outcome (identify tool-call failure patterns).
- H=2: "Users need notebook-to-pipeline conversion without writing pipeline code. Context: KALE and Elyra are upstream projects that address this; engineering should evaluate these and other approaches." → Need is clear without the context. Engineering is free to choose.
- H=1: "Build KALE integration for notebook-to-pipeline conversion." → KALE is mandated as the solution, not offered as context.

#### Not a task
- T=0: "Rename Trustyai-explainability to TrustyAI" with description "Look at the title." → Pure housekeeping. No customer-facing need.
- T=1: "When config says false and job requests true, don't create the pod — return an error instead." (with truth tables of flag behavior) → Valid need, but written as an implementation task rather than a business need. Could be rewritten as: "Users should get clear feedback when their evaluation job conflicts with platform policy."
- T=2: "Allow users to approve non-read tool calls before execution to prevent destructive actions from AI hallucination." → Clear business need: safety and risk mitigation.

#### Right-sized
- R=2: "Redesign subscription model to support multi-tier access and declarative configuration." → Multiple deliverables (entity model, GitOps enablement, validation) but each requires the others to function at all. Cannot ship GitOps without the new entity model. Single coherent need.
- R=1: "Support multi-tier subscriptions and add usage analytics reporting." → Multi-tier access solves an access control problem for platform admins. Usage analytics solves a billing/visibility problem for finance teams. Different personas, independently valuable, bundled by proximity to the subscription system.
- R=0: "Overhaul platform security: add RBAC, audit logging, network policies, and vulnerability scanning." → Four distinct capabilities serving different compliance requirements, each needing its own strategy feature.
- R=2: "Support GPU X across RHAII, RHEL AI, and RHOAI for workbenches, serving, and training." → Same capability across deployment targets. Workbenches, serving, and training all require GPU X enablement to function — they share upstream driver/framework work.
- R=2: "Dashboard homepage with unified entry points, tool launch, and persona-based guidance." → Entry points without launch are useless; launch without entry points has no surface. Tightly coupled facets of a single discovery experience.
- R=1: "Support GPU X across all products AND add GPU performance benchmarking dashboards." → Benchmarking serves a different persona (ops/perf engineers vs data scientists) and provides standalone value without GPU enablement.
- R=1: "Data catalog with registration, search, data cards, AND lineage visualization." → Registration+search+cards are interdependent (catalog core). Lineage visualization serves a different purpose (traceability) and provides standalone value to compliance teams without the catalog UI.

### Pass/Fail
- Pass: Total >= 7/10 AND no zeros on any criterion
- Fail: Total < 7 OR any zero (automatic fail regardless of total)
